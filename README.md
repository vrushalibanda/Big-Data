# Big-Data
The course project includes 3 parts. The first part is to develop a Mapper and Reducer application to retrieve Year and Temperature from original NCDC records (i.e., the dataset we are using for this class) and then write the Year and Temperature data into a text file. 
The second part is to load the text file into Pig and get the highest and lowest temperatures for each year.
The third part is to load the text file into Hive and get the average temperature for each year.
